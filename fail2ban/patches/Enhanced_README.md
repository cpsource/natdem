# Fail2Ban Configuration: Changing iptables from `-I` to `-A`

This guide provides instructions on how to modify Fail2Ban to use `-A` (append) instead of `-I` (insert) when adding rules to iptables. Additionally, it discusses how to handle iptables chain conditions dynamically in Fail2Ban configuration files.

## ‚ùì Question: Can Fail2Ban be Changed from `-I` to `-A`?

Yes, you can configure Fail2Ban to use `-A` (append) instead of `-I` (insert) when adding rules to iptables. By default, Fail2Ban uses `-I` to insert rules at the top of the iptables chain to ensure they are evaluated first. However, if you want the rules to be appended to the end of the chain (using `-A`), this behavior can be customized.

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps to change Fail2Ban from `-I` to `-A`:

1. **Open Fail2Ban's configuration file**:
   The global actions related to how Fail2Ban interacts with iptables can be found in the `action.d` directory, typically located in `/etc/fail2ban/`. The specific file that controls iptables actions is `iptables.conf` (or `iptables-multiport.conf` depending on the setup).

   Open this file for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables.conf
   ```

2. **Modify the insert action to append**:
   In the `iptables.conf` file, search for lines where Fail2Ban is using `-I` to insert rules. You will typically find a section that looks like this:

   ```bash
   actionban = iptables -I f2b-<name> 1 -s <ip> -j <blocktype>
   ```

   Change the `-I` (insert) to `-A` (append) so that rules are appended to the end of the chain. After modification, the line will look like this:

   ```bash
   actionban = iptables -A f2b-<name> -s <ip> -j <blocktype>
   ```

   You may also find a similar line for IPv6 (`ip6tables`), so be sure to change both if necessary:
   
   ```bash
   actionban = ip6tables -A f2b-<name> -s <ip> -j <blocktype>
   ```

3. **Save the file and exit**:
   After making the necessary changes, save the file (`Ctrl + O` in `nano`) and exit (`Ctrl + X`).

4. **Restart Fail2Ban**:
   For the changes to take effect, you will need to restart the Fail2Ban service:
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
   ```

5. **Verify the Changes**:
   After restarting Fail2Ban, you can test the setup by causing a ban (e.g., by triggering a failed login) and then inspecting the iptables rules to ensure they are being appended to the end of the chain:
   
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -S
   ```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations:
- **Order of Rules**: Appending rules to the end of the chain means they will be evaluated after any existing rules. This could impact the effectiveness of Fail2Ban if other rules are processed first (e.g., if another rule earlier in the chain allows or blocks traffic before Fail2Ban's rule is evaluated).

## üîß How to Modify the `actionstart` Line to Use `-A` for `INPUT`

You can modify the `actionstart` section of your Fail2Ban configuration to use `-A` (append) for the `INPUT` chain and `-I` (insert) for other chains.

### Example Code:

```bash
actionstart = <iptables> -N f2b-<name>
              <iptables> -A f2b-<name> -j <returntype>
              $( [ "<chain>" = "INPUT" ] && echo "<iptables> -A <chain> -p <protocol> -m multiport --dports <port> -j f2b-<name>" || echo "<iptables> -I <chain> 1 -p <protocol> -m multiport --dports <port> -j f2b-<name>" )
              <iptables> -N f2b-<name>-log
              <iptables> -I f2b-<name>-log -j LOG --log-prefix "$(expr f2b-<name> : '\(.\{1,23\}\)'):DROP " --log-level warning -m limit --limit 6/m --limit-burst 2
              <iptables> -A f2b-<name>-log -j <blocktype>
```

### Key Part of the Modification:
- The third line contains an inline conditional (`$(...)`) that checks if the chain is `"INPUT"`.
  - If `<chain>` is `"INPUT"`, it uses `-A` to append the rule to the end of the chain.
  - Otherwise, it uses `-I` to insert the rule at the top of the chain.

### üìù Steps to Apply:
1. Open the action file (`iptables.conf` or similar) for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables.conf
   ```

2. Add the modified `actionstart` block.

3. Save the file and restart Fail2Ban:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
   ```

4. Verify the behavior by inspecting the iptables rules using:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -S
   ```

## üîÑ Modify the `actionstart` Inline for `-I` with Conditional `-A`

To handle `-A` for the `INPUT` chain and `-I` for other chains in an inline statement, you can adjust the following:

```bash
_ipt_add_rules = <_ipt_for_proto-iter>
              { %(_ipt_check_rule)s >/dev/null 2>&1; } || { [ "<chain>" = "INPUT" ] && <iptables> -A <chain> %(_ipt_chain_rule)s || <iptables> -I <chain> %(_ipt_chain_rule)s; }
              <_ipt_for_proto-done>
```

### Explanation:
- The inline conditional (`[ "<chain>" = "INPUT" ] && ... || ...`) checks if the chain is `"INPUT"`.
  - If true, it uses `-A` to append the rule.
  - Otherwise, it uses `-I` to insert the rule at the beginning of the chain.

## üêç How Python3 Uses `%(string)s`

In Fail2Ban, the `%(string)s` formatting is used to dynamically replace placeholders in configuration strings with actual values at runtime. This is part of Python's old-style string formatting, where placeholders are replaced by values passed to the string in the form of a dictionary.

### Example:

```python
chainX = "INPUT"
ip = "192.168.1.1"
blocktype = "DROP"

command = "<iptables> -I %(chain)s -s %(ip)s -j %(blocktype)s" % {
    "chain": chainX,
    "ip": ip,
    "blocktype": blocktype
}

print(command)
```

### Output:
```bash
<iptables> -I INPUT -s 192.168.1.1 -j DROP
```

This example shows how the `%` operator is used to replace placeholders like `%(chain)s`, `%(ip)s`, and `%(blocktype)s` with actual values.
