# SSH Connection Reset by Remote Host

## Overview

This document describes the meaning of the SSH connection reset error logged in `journalctl`, how to interpret the message, and possible causes and actions.

### Sample Error
```
Sep 07 07:43:48 ip-172-26-10-222 sshd[53517]: Connection reset by 198.235.24.150 port 57610 [preauth]
```

### Explanation

- **Date/Time**: The log entry was recorded on **Sep 07 07:43:48**.
- **Host**: The system has the hostname **ip-172-26-10-222**.
- **Service**: The SSH daemon (`sshd`) is responsible for the log entry.
- **PID**: The process ID handling the connection is **53517**.
- **Message**: "Connection reset by 198.235.24.150 port 57610 [preauth]" means that the remote client with IP **198.235.24.150** initiated a connection on port **57610** but reset (dropped) the connection before authentication could proceed. The `[preauth]` tag indicates that the connection never reached the authentication phase.

## Possible Causes

1. **Client-Side Interruption**: The remote client could have deliberately or accidentally disconnected.
2. **Network Issues**: Temporary network problems may cause the connection to drop.
3. **Malicious Activity**: A common cause of such logs is port scanning or SSH brute force attempts, where attackers probe the SSH service and reset connections before fully authenticating.

## Recommended Actions

- **Monitor the IP**: Check whether the IP address shows up frequently in your logs. This could indicate a brute force attack or malicious scanning.
- **Blocking Malicious IPs**: If you observe multiple failed attempts from the same IP address, consider blocking it using firewall rules (e.g., `iptables`, `ufw`).
- **Use Fail2Ban**: You can configure Fail2Ban to automatically ban IP addresses after a certain number of failed SSH login attempts.

### Example of Blocking an IP with `iptables`
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 198.235.24.150 -j DROP
```

### Example of Monitoring SSH Logs
You can use the following command to filter SSH logs:
```
sudo journalctl -u sshd | grep 'Connection reset'
```

## Further Protection

Consider using the following to enhance the security of your SSH service:
- Disable password authentication and use SSH keys only.
- Use a non-standard SSH port.
- Restrict access by IP address.
