# MariaDB Connection Issue Troubleshooting

## Overview

This guide helps troubleshoot a common warning in MariaDB, specifically when a connection is aborted before authentication. The warning might appear in `journalctl` logs, and understanding its cause can help in addressing potential security risks, configuration issues, or network problems.

### Example Error in `journalctl`

```
Sep 06 23:43:21 ip-172-26-10-222 mariadbd[31886]: 2024-09-06 23:43:21 339 [Warning] Aborted connection 339 to db: 'unconnected' user: 'unauthenticated' host: '199.45.154.124' (This connection closed normally without authentication)
```

### Key Components of the Warning
- **Aborted connection [connection_id]**: A specific connection to the MariaDB instance was aborted.
- **db: 'unconnected'**: The connection to the database was not completed before disconnection.
- **user: 'unauthenticated'**: No user successfully authenticated during the connection attempt.
- **host: '[IP address]'**: The external IP address that attempted the connection.
- **(This connection closed normally without authentication)**: The connection was closed without successful authentication, likely indicating an issue with the connection process or security.

## Possible Causes
1. **Unsuccessful Authentication Attempt**: 
   - The client may have failed to provide the correct credentials or none at all. This can result from an incorrect configuration on the client-side or invalid credentials being used.

2. **Connection Timeout**:
   - The connection might have timed out before the authentication process could complete. This can happen due to network delays or issues with the client's connectivity.

3. **Brute-Force Attempts**:
   - If this warning repeats frequently from the same IP address or from multiple different IPs, it could indicate a brute-force attack, where unauthorized users try to guess valid credentials.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - If the connection was closed due to network instability, MariaDB might not receive the authentication details in time, causing the aborted connection.

## Security Concerns

If you notice repetitive aborted connections from unknown IP addresses, especially with the user being unauthenticated, this could indicate a potential brute-force attack. To address this:

1. **Monitor and Log Connections**:
   - Keep track of aborted connection attempts, particularly from suspicious or repeated IP addresses.
   - Increase logging verbosity to capture more detailed information about connection attempts.

2. **Block Malicious IPs**:
   - Use a firewall or MariaDB’s own access controls to block IPs that seem suspicious or are repeatedly trying to connect without authentication.
   - Consider integrating IP blocking measures, especially if you’ve handled brute-force attempts on other services (e.g., SSH).

## Steps to Address

### 1. Investigate the Source of the IP
   - Determine if the IP address (in this case, `199.45.154.124`) is known to you. If not, it could be part of an unauthorized access attempt.

### 2. Check MariaDB Authentication Logs
   - Review the MariaDB authentication logs to see if the client sent credentials and whether they were invalid or missing entirely.
   
### 3. Adjust Network or Timeout Configurations
   - Review the network setup and ensure there are no issues with connectivity between clients and the database server.
   - Consider increasing the timeout period for authentication if network delays are common.

### 4. Use Firewalls or Connection Limits
   - Implement firewall rules to block unauthorized access attempts from unknown IP addresses.
   - Limit the number of connection attempts or failed logins to reduce the risk of brute-force attacks.

## Conclusion

MariaDB warnings about aborted connections without authentication can stem from various causes, including network issues, incorrect credentials, or potential security threats. Monitoring and taking appropriate actions—such as blocking suspicious IP addresses and reviewing authentication logs—can help ensure your database remains secure and functional.
