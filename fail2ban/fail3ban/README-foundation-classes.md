Here is the updated list of your foundation classes:

1. **`whitelist` class in `whitelist.py`**: Handles whitelisting IP addresses.
2. **`blacklist` class in `blacklist.py`**: Handles blacklisting IP addresses.
3. **`ruleset` class in `ruleset.py`**: Handles processing `.conf` files, extracting regexes from the `[Definition]` section, managing the `enabled` flag, and replacing rules that begin with `^` or `^` followed by spaces with a regex to skip 0 or more spaces.
4. **`fail3banInit` class in `fail3banInit.py`**: Reads variables from the `init.ctl` file and provides methods to retrieve variable values.
5. **`iptables` class in `iptables.py`**: Manages iptables rules, including adding/removing IP addresses and chains, and removing all fail3ban-related chains and rules.
6. **`Config` class in `config.py`**: Reads a `config.ctl` file of the form `variable = value` (e.g., `debug = true`) and provides a `get_value('variable-name')` method to retrieve the value of a specified variable.

Let me know if you need to modify or add anything to the list!
