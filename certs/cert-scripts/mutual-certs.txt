can I condition port 443 with apache2 so that users must present a valid certificate before the web page is processed?

Yes, you can configure Apache to require client certificates for accessing a website on port 443 (HTTPS). This is known as "Mutual SSL/TLS Authentication" or "Client Certificate Authentication." Here’s how you can set it up:

1. Enable SSL Module
First, ensure that the SSL module is enabled in Apache:

bash
Copy code
sudo a2enmod ssl
2. Set Up Your SSL Virtual Host
You need to edit your SSL virtual host configuration file, typically found in /etc/apache2/sites-available/. Here’s an example configuration:

apache
Copy code
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.com.key
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    # Enable client certificate verification
    SSLVerifyClient require
    SSLVerifyDepth 2

    # Path to the client certificates that will be trusted
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
3. SSLVerifyClient Directive
The key directive here is SSLVerifyClient. You can set it to:

none: No client certificate is required.
optional: The server will request a client certificate, but the client can choose whether or not to provide it.
require: A valid client certificate is required; the connection will be terminated if not provided.
4. SSLVerifyDepth Directive
SSLVerifyDepth specifies the maximum depth of the certificate chain that the server will accept.

5. Restart Apache
After making these changes, restart Apache to apply the configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
6. Testing
When configured correctly, any user trying to access the website over HTTPS will be required to present a valid client certificate that is signed by a trusted CA (as specified by SSLCACertificateFile).

This setup ensures that only clients with valid certificates can access the web page, effectively adding a layer of security through mutual authentication.

Is the certificate information available for a web page to read?

Yes, the certificate information provided by the client during the SSL/TLS handshake can be made available to your web application for processing. Apache allows you to expose certain details of the client certificate as environment variables, which can then be accessed by your application.

How to Expose Certificate Information
To expose the client certificate information, you can use the SSLOptions directive in your Apache configuration. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. Modify Your SSL Virtual Host Configuration
In your SSL virtual host configuration file, add the following:

apache
Copy code
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.com.key
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    # Enable client certificate verification
    SSLVerifyClient require
    SSLVerifyDepth 2

    # Path to the client certificates that will be trusted
    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

    # Expose client certificate information as environment variables
    SSLOptions +ExportCertData

    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
2. Available Environment Variables
When SSLOptions +ExportCertData is set, Apache exposes several environment variables related to the client certificate:

SSL_CLIENT_S_DN: The distinguished name (DN) of the client certificate subject.
SSL_CLIENT_I_DN: The DN of the issuer of the client certificate.
SSL_CLIENT_M_SERIAL: The serial number of the client certificate.
SSL_CLIENT_V_START: The start date of the client certificate's validity period.
SSL_CLIENT_V_END: The end date of the client certificate's validity period.
SSL_CLIENT_CERT: The entire client certificate in PEM format.
These variables can be accessed within your web application. For example, in a PHP script:

php
Copy code
<?php
$client_dn = $_SERVER['SSL_CLIENT_S_DN'];
$client_serial = $_SERVER['SSL_CLIENT_M_SERIAL'];

echo "Client DN: " . $client_dn . "<br>";
echo "Client Serial: " . $client_serial . "<br>";
?>
3. Restart Apache
After making these changes, restart Apache:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Accessing the Certificate Information
Your web application can now read the client certificate details through these environment variables. This information can be used for logging, access control, or other application-specific purposes.

By exposing the client certificate details, you can effectively integrate mutual authentication into your application logic, providing additional layers of security and customization based on the user's certificate.
